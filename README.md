# Snake
A clone of the classic game Snake where the user controls (with keyboard) 
a snake made of block segments to collect food pieces. The snake's body 
grows upon each collection of food, and the goal is to collect as much 
food as possible and grow the snake as large as possible while avoiding 
collision with game boundaries and not colliding snake's body into itself.
